Module Name: EEG Data Processing and Feature Extraction

Description:
    This module provides functions and utilities for processing EEG data, extracting features,
    and preparing the data for model training and evaluation. The functions cover a range of
    tasks including filtering raw EEG data, segmenting EEG signals into chunks, applying
    feature extraction methods, and organizing file paths for different EEG data sessions.

Functions:
    - filter_eeg: Applies a bandpass filter and common average referencing to raw EEG data.
    - split_eeg: Splits the EEG data into equal-length chunks based on a specified chunk length.
    - process_file: Processes a raw EEG data file, applies filtering and chunking, and assigns labels.
    - pad_and_split: Pads an array to a specified block size and splits it into blocks.
    - process_feature_file: Processes feature-based EEG data files according to the specified feature
      extraction method, chunking the data and assigning labels.
    - subject_file_map: Maps subjects and sessions to their corresponding EEG data files based on
      folder structure and file naming conventions.

Usage:
    This module is intended for preprocessing and feature extraction in EEG-based machine learning tasks.
    It supports multiple feature extraction methods and can handle different subjects and sessions in a
    structured way.

    Pads an array to a specified block size and splits it into smaller blocks along the specified axis.

    :param array: The input 3D array to be padded and split, with shape (channels, length, features).
    :type array: np.ndarray
    :param block_size: The length of each block after splitting.
    :type block_size: int
    :return: A list of blocks, where each block has shape (channels, block_size, features).
    :rtype: list[np.ndarray]

    This function calculates the necessary padding to make the array length divisible by `block_size`.
    It pads the array by repeating the initial elements, if needed, and then splits the array into
    non-overlapping blocks of the specified `block_size`.

    Steps:
        1. Compute the padding length required to make the array length divisible by `block_size`.
        2. If padding is needed, repeat the initial portion of the array to fill the padding length.
        3. Split the padded array into smaller blocks along the length dimension.

    Example:
        Given an array with shape (channels, 100, features) and block_size of 20, the function pads
        the array to 120 if necessary, then splits it into 6 blocks of shape (channels, 20, features).

            - Matches the trial name using the regex pattern to identify trial indices.
            - Transposes the trial data to ensure correct shape.
            - Splits the trial data into chunks of size `block_size` using `pad_and_split`.
            - Appends each chunk to `chunk_list` and assigns the corresponding label from `labels`.
        4. Ensures that all expected trials (1 through 24) are present in the file. Raises an exception
           if any trial is missing.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an invalid feature method is specified, or if any expected trials are missing from the file.

def subject_file_map(folder: str) -> dict[Subject, dict[Session, str]]:

    Creates a mapping of EEG data files by subject and session.

    :param folder: The path to the root folder containing the feature data organized by session.
    :type folder: str
    :return: A nested dictionary where each subject is mapped to another dictionary that maps each session
             to the corresponding file path.
    :rtype: dict[Subject, dict[Session, str]]

    This function scans the specified folder and organizes EEG data files into a nested dictionary structure
    based on subject and session. The expected folder structure is such that session folders contain files
    named with the format "<subject>_<date>.mat", where:
        - <subject> is the subject identifier (e.g., "1", "2").
        - <date> is an 8-digit date in the file name.

    Steps:
        1. Initialize an empty dictionary for each subject in the `file_map`.
        2. Traverse the folder structure recursively using `os.walk`.
        3. Extract the session number from the folder name and match files against a specific pattern.
        4. For each file matching the pattern, extract the subject ID and session number.
        5. Map each file path to the appropriate subject and session in `file_map`.

    Example:
        Given a folder structure like:
        ```
        root/
        âââ session1/
        â   âââ 1_20220101.mat
        â   âââ 2_20220101.mat
        âââ session2/
        â   âââ 1_20220102.mat
        â   âââ 2_20220102.mat
        ```

        `subject_file_map("root")` will return:
        ```
        {
            Subject.ONE: {Session.ONE: "root/session1/1_20220101.mat", Session.TWO: "root/session2/1_20220102.mat"},
            Subject.TWO: {Session.ONE: "root/session1/2_20220101.mat", Session.TWO: "root/session2/2_20220102.mat"},
        }
        ```

    Note:
        - The function assumes that the folder names represent session numbers, and the files follow the naming
          convention "<subject>_<date>.mat".
        - If a file does not match the expected pattern, it will be ignored.
