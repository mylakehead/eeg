Module Name: EEG Emotion Data Definition

Description:
    This module defines several enumerations and mappings for use in an EEG-based emotion recognition project.
    The enumerations represent categorical data such as gender, emotion types, subjects, sessions, and feature
    extraction methods. Additionally, mappings are defined to link gender with specific subjects and to label
    sessions with a sequence of emotional states.

    The module includes the following enumerations and dictionaries:
        - Gender: An enumeration for subject gender (FEMALE, MALE).
        - Emotion: An enumeration for different emotion labels (NEUTRAL, SAD, FEAR, HAPPY).
        - Subject: An enumeration for subject identifiers (ONE through FIFTEEN).
        - Session: An enumeration for session numbers (ONE, TWO, THREE).
        - FeatureMethod: An enumeration for feature extraction methods (DE_LDS, DE_MOVING_AVE, PSD_LDS, PSD_MOVING_AVE).
        - gender_subject: A dictionary mapping each gender to a list of associated subjects.
        - session_label: A dictionary mapping each session to a sequence of emotion labels for individual trials.

    Reference: https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed-iv.html

Usage:
    These enumerations and mappings are used to provide structured data for training or evaluating emotion
    recognition models, and to ensure consistency in data processing and feature extraction.
